# Chess
The program files I'm using to create a program that can accept valid chess moves in order to play a game.

To-do list:

wow I'm dumb

holy hell check is so broken -- details about this in Chess Update 6

handling en passant

handling checkmate

using unicode characters instead of letters for chess pieces

actually make a GUI
