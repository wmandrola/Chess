# Chess
The program files I'm using to create a program that can accept valid chess moves in order to play a game.

To-do list:

Create a method to look for checkmate or stalemate

Possibly allow users to offer a draw

Other draw detections: insufficient mating material, fifty move rule

Create a GUI

Create an AI player
