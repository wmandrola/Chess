# Chess
The program files I'm using to create a program that can accept valid chess moves in order to play a game.

To-do list:

Complete/fix the problems with the code to handle en passant in ChessClient

Create a method to look for checkmate or stalemate

Possibly allow users to offer a draw

Create a GUI

Create an AI player
