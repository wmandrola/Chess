# Chess
The program files I'm using to create a program that can accept valid chess moves in order to play a game.

To-do list:

fix bug with king moves other than castling being illegal (should be fixed but not thoroughly tested)

found bug where queen could clip through pawn by moving diagonally left

found bug where king was not properly recognized as in check when king on e2 and opposing queen on e1

holy hell check is so broken

handling en passant

handling checkmate

using unicode characters instead of letters for chess pieces

actually make a GUI
