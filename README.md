# Chess
The program files I'm using to create a program that can accept valid chess moves in order to play a game.

To-do list:

fix bug with king moves other than castling being illegal

holy hell check is so broken

handling en passant

handling checkmate

using unicode characters instead of letters for chess pieces

actually make a GUI
